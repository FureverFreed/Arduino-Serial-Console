# Arduino-Serial-Console
A simple serial console that lets you control an Arduino UNO R3 using Termite-3.2

Requirements:
Arduino UNO R3
Computer with Termite-3.2
USB-A male to USB-B male cable

Dear user,
This is a serial console that I have been working on for a while that allows you to easily communicate with and control an Arduino UNO R3. It's easy to use, and fun to tinker with. Look for the latest version and download and upload it to the Arduino.

I have programmed the console to work perfectly with Termite-3.2, and I recommend you don't use any other serial console application, as any other might make bad things happen, like an unresponsive console. Termite-3.2 has the perfect settings and is easy enough to use that I believe you'll enjoy using it.

If you would like to contribute and help with the project, please comment and let me know! If you have something that I should change in the code, comment and let me know! Tell me what you think! I really appreciate it.

Thanks,
